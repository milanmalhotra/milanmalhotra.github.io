                            <p>MarginEdge is an IT company that helps eliminate restaurant's need to have on paper their invoices, updated recipes, administartive details, and more. MarginEdge digitalizes everything and helps streamline the process, taking
                                away much stress from restaurants. At my time with MarginEdge, I started with creating queries within Redash using SQL. After creating these queries, the data was used in Tableau to create charts. My task was to take these
                                charts and create a simple website for the executives to use and easily view the charts. After completing that site, I moved onto working on the company's main website. Here I redesigned the landing page, created a page
                                that shows all the restaurants we work with, and created individual pages for each restaurant that displays a case study. This was my first internship and to this day, they still have some of the pages live that I created.
